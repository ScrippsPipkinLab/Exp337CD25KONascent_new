AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /gpfs/group/pipkin/hdiao/Exp337/0_fastq/337_18_1_Total.fastq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera	2	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.00
Using Nextera adapter for trimming (count: 2). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)
