AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /gpfs/group/pipkin/hdiao/Exp337/0_fastq/337_11_1_Total.fastq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	6	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.00
smallRNA	1	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 6). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 1)
