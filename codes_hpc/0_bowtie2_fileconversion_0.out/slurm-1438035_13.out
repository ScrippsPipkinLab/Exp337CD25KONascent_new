AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /gpfs/group/pipkin/hdiao/Exp337/0_fastq/337_13_1_Total.fastq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
smallRNA	3	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Nextera	3	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
Illumina	1	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count smallRNA: 3, count Nextera: 3)
Using smallRNA adapter for trimming (count: 3). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 3)

Setting the Illumina smallRNA 5' adapter as adapter 2: 'GATCGTCGGACT'
