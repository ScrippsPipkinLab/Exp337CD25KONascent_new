Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> 337-14_R1.fastq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	3	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.00
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 3). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)
