Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')


AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> 337-13_R1.fastq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
smallRNA	3	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Nextera	3	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
Illumina	1	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.00
Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at /opt/applications/trimgalore/0.4.1/bin/trim_galore line 1141, <AUTODETECT> line 4000000.
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count smallRNA: 3, count Nextera: )
Using smallRNA adapter for trimming (count: 3). Second best hit was Nextera (count: 3)

Reducing length cutoff to 16bp for small RNA-Seq reads because a cutoff of 20bp may remove some short species of small RNAs if they had been trimmed by 1,2 or 3bp
